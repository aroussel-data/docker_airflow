# docker_airflow
Repo for Apache's workflow management tool

**Prerequisites**
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

**Running**
- docker-compose up
- Airflow will be running at on [port 8080](localhost:8080)

**NOTES**
- For the moment this is still just a sequential executor. I'll be migrating it to a Local and eventually Celery executor.
